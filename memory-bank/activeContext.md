# Active Context: Personal Website (Hero + About Section Refinement)

## 1. Current Focus

*   Testing the refined About section layout, background, and new image filter effect.
*   Verifying the scroll transition and internal animations work correctly with the updated structure.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **AboutSection Component Update:**
    *   Centered text content on smaller screens, left-aligned on larger screens.
    *   Removed the bottom background image section.
    *   Applied a dark gradient background (`primary` shades) to the entire section.
    *   Removed the split-circle visual element.
    *   Added a new placeholder image (Picsum) to the right column.
    *   Applied Tailwind filters (`grayscale`, `contrast`, `brightness`) and blend modes (`mix-blend-multiply`, `mix-blend-overlay`) to the new image to approximate the reference style.
    *   Updated GSAP `onMounted` animations to target the new image container instead of the circle.
*   No changes made to `pages/index.vue` in this step, as the `AboutSection` component is self-contained regarding these visual updates.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Run the development server (`npm run dev` or similar).
*   Test the visual appearance of the updated About section, paying attention to the image filter and gradient background.
*   Test the responsiveness of the new layout.
*   Verify scroll and internal animations are functioning as expected.
*   Consider fine-tuning the image filters or trying CSS `clip-path` / masking if a closer match to the reference image's blocky cut-out effect is desired later.
*   Replace placeholder content (text and image URL) when available.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Using Tailwind filters and blend modes for the image effect as a first pass.
*   The section now uses a gradient background instead of a bottom image.
