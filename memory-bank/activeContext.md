# Active Context: Personal Website (Full Screen Backgrounds)

## 1. Current Focus

*   Testing if the AboutSection's gradient background now correctly covers the full screen when the section is active via scroll animation.
*   Verifying the layout and centering remain correct after moving background styles.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Background Strategy Update:**
    *   Removed background gradient classes from the root `<section>` element within `components/AboutSection.vue`.
    *   Applied the same background gradient classes (`bg-gradient-to-br from-primary-800...`) directly to the container `div` (`ref="nextSection"`) in `pages/index.vue`.
    *   This aims to make the `AboutSection`'s background (when active) cover the full viewport, similar to the `HeroSection`.
*   **pages/index.vue Update:**
    *   Added `flex items-center justify-center` classes to the `nextSection` div for vertical centering (previous step).
*   **AboutSection.vue Refactoring:**
    *   Previous refactoring steps applied (cleaning HTML/CSS).
*   Added glitch hover effect and gradient text to `AboutSection.vue` (previous steps).

## 3. Next Steps

*   Run the development server (`npm run dev` or similar).
*   Test the scroll animation: Confirm that as the `AboutSection` scrolls into view and becomes the pinned element, its designated gradient background fills the entire screen.
*   Ensure the content within `AboutSection` remains centered correctly on the full-screen background.
*   Consider adding a global fallback background color/gradient (e.g., in `layouts/default.vue` or global CSS) later to handle transitions or empty space.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Moving section-specific, full-screen backgrounds to the container elements animated by ScrollTrigger in `pages/index.vue` instead of applying them within the components themselves.
