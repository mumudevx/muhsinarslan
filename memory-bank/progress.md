# Progress: Personal Website

## 1. What Works

*   Memory Bank structure is established.
*   Initial project requirements and technical decisions are documented.
*   Basic Nuxt.js project structure exists.
*   Tailwind CSS is integrated.
*   GSAP is integrated.
*   `components/HeroSection.vue` exists and is rendered.
*   `components/AboutSection.vue` created and refined:
    *   Responsive text layout (centered/left-aligned).
    *   Dark gradient background.
    *   Filtered placeholder image.
    *   Basic fade-in animations (text and image).
*   `AboutSection` is integrated into `pages/index.vue`.
*   Scroll-based transition animation between Hero and About sections is implemented.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **Testing & Refinement:** Thorough testing of About section visuals, responsiveness, and animations.
*   **Content:** Replacing placeholders in `AboutSection`.
*   **Image Effect (Optional):** Explore CSS `clip-path`/masking for a more accurate blocky cut-out effect if desired.
*   **Other Pages:** Portfolio, Gallery, Blog, Contact pages.
*   **Other Components:** Header, Footer, Navigation, Cards, etc.
*   **Full Content Integration:** Project data, blog posts, photos.
*   **Advanced Animations:** Further GSAP enhancements.
*   **Layout:** Defining the main layout in `layouts/default.vue`.
*   **Deployment Configuration:** Setting up for GitHub Pages.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** 1 - Core Section Implementation (Hero + About Refinement)
*   **Overall Progress:** ~18% (Core sections refined, awaiting testing)
