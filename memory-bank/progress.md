# Progress: Personal Website

## 1. What Works

*   Memory Bank structure is established.
*   Initial project requirements and technical decisions are documented.
*   Basic Nuxt.js project structure exists.
*   Tailwind CSS is integrated.
*   GSAP is integrated.
*   `components/HeroSection.vue` exists and is rendered.
*   `components/AboutSection.vue` created and refined:
    *   Responsive text layout (centered/left-aligned).
    *   Dark gradient background.
    *   Filtered placeholder image.
    *   Basic fade-in animations (text and image).
*   `components/MyWorksSection.vue` exists and is rendered.
*   `components/GallerySection.vue` created with infinite scroll animation and image zoom.
*   Sections are integrated into `pages/index.vue`.
*   Scroll-based transition animation between sections is implemented.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **`components/LatestPostsSection.vue`:** Bento grid layout for recent blog posts.
*   **Testing & Refinement:** Thorough testing of all sections visuals, responsiveness, and animations (especially Gallery responsiveness/height calculation robustness).
*   **Content:** Replacing placeholders in all sections (About, Gallery images, Blog posts).
*   **Image Effect (Optional):** Explore CSS `clip-path`/masking for `AboutSection` image.
*   **Other Pages:** Blog (listing/detail), Contact pages (if needed).
*   **Other Components:** Header, Footer, Navigation (if needed).
*   **Full Content Integration:** Project data, blog posts, photos.
*   **Advanced Animations:** Further GSAP enhancements.
*   **Layout:** Defining the main layout in `layouts/default.vue`.
*   **Deployment Configuration:** Setting up for GitHub Pages.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** 3 - Feature Section Implementation (`LatestPostsSection`)
*   **Overall Progress:** ~35% (Gallery done, starting blog section)

## 4. Known Issues

*   Gallery section's height calculation (`verticalLoop`) might still need refinement depending on image loading variability. Thorough testing needed.
