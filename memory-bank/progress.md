# Progress: Personal Website

## 1. What Works

*   Memory Bank structure is established.
*   Initial project requirements and technical decisions are documented.
*   Basic Nuxt.js project structure exists.
*   Tailwind CSS is integrated.
*   GSAP is integrated.
*   `components/HeroSection.vue` exists and is rendered.
*   `components/AboutSection.vue` created and refined:
    *   Responsive text layout (centered/left-aligned).
    *   Dark gradient background.
    *   Filtered placeholder image.
    *   Basic fade-in animations (text and image).
*   `components/MyWorksSection.vue` exists and is rendered.
*   `components/GallerySection.vue` created with infinite scroll animation and image zoom.
*   `components/LatestPostsSection.vue` with Bento grid (Nuxt Content).
*   `pages/index.vue` integrates all main sections.
*   `pages/blog/index.vue` lists all blog posts with lazy loading.
*   `pages/blog/[slug].vue` displays individual blog posts.
*   `pages/work/index.vue` lists all work projects with lazy loading and bento grid.
*   `pages/work/[slug].vue` displays individual work projects.
*   `components/CursorFollower.vue` implemented with visibility rules.
*   Basic Tailwind typography setup.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **`components/ConnectSection.vue`:** Contact form and social links section.
*   **Form Submission Logic:** Backend integration or service (e.g., Netlify Forms, Formspree) for the contact form.
*   **Content:** Finalizing placeholder content in all sections (About, Works, Blog posts, social links, etc.).
*   **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing of responsiveness, animations, functionality across all browsers/devices.
*   **Nuxt Content API Version Check:** Confirm and standardize API usage (v1 vs v2) if discrepancies exist (e.g., MyWorksSection vs LatestPostsSection).
*   **Layout:** Defining the main layout in `layouts/default.vue`.
*   **Deployment Configuration:** Setting up for GitHub Pages.
*   **Advanced Features/Polish:** Any further enhancements.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** 4 - Final Section Implementation (`ConnectSection`)
*   **Overall Progress:** ~65% (Core sections and list/detail pages done, starting contact section)

## 4. Known Issues

*   Potential Nuxt Content API version inconsistency between components.
*   Gallery height calculation might still need edge-case testing.
