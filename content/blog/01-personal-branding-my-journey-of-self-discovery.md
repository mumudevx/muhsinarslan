This year, I decided to embark on the journey of building my personal brand. The primary reason behind this decision is to optimize my online presence. The first, and perhaps most critical, step in this journey is turning the focus inward for self-assessment. As a software engineer, solopreneur, and SaaS builder, I believe I cannot build a solid brand without understanding what I represent, the values I operate by, and what makes me unique. Just like analyzing requirements before starting a project, the foundation of a personal brand must be laid correctly. In this post, I will share my self-assessment process and the insights gained during this experience.

Looking back at my self-discovery process, I believe there are a few key components:

## Confronting the SWOT Analysis
Honestly, listing my strengths (analytical problem-solving, effective use of AI tools, language-agnostic thinking despite my C#/.NET experience) was easy. However, acknowledging my weaknesses (my agility to pivot in a very dynamic field, difficulties in analyzing prolonged iteration improvement processes) and identifying areas for development were essential for making my brand authentic. Recognizing the opportunities (AI and automation trends) and threats (rapidly changing technology, economic uncertainties) in my focus sectors guided my strategy formulation.

## Values and Passions
The "innovation," "continuous learning," and "user-centricity" underlying my "Why" are not just fancy words; they are the driving forces at the core of everything I do. Particularly, my passion for solving the efficiency problems of solopreneurs and SMEs with technology, especially AI-powered structures, constitutes the real "why" of my brand. As someone embarking on this process, the first questions you should ask yourself are "What is my why?" and "Which values guide me?"

## Awareness of Existing and Needed Skills
Of course, my technical skills are important. However, alongside my technical abilities, my soft skills, such as my problem-solving approach, communication strength, and collaborative aptitude, are also part of my personal brand. I believe that gaining a clear picture of both technical and soft skills, taking a high-level overview, plays a significant role in defining the value proposition.

## Personal Mission and Vision
I've defined my mission as "To provide innovative, user-centric software solutions that enhance the productivity of solopreneurs and SMEs." My vision is "To become a trusted provider and thought leader in this field." These goals guide every step I take and give my brand purpose.

It's also important to remember that self-assessment isn't a one-time task but a continuous process of discovery. Repeating this process periodically can be beneficial for intrinsically understanding new parameters introduced by change. If you want to build your personal brand on solid foundations, I recommend asking yourself these questions:

- What truly motivates you? Which values are non-negotiable for you?
- What are your strongest technical and soft skills? In which areas do you want to improve?
- What unique experiences or perspectives differentiate you from others?
- What do you want to achieve in the short and long term? What is your personal mission and vision?

Your honest answers to these questions will lay the foundation for an authentic and effective personal brand and will differentiate you in the market. In the next step, I will discuss how I define my target audience – who I am speaking to – while building my personal brand upon this foundation.
