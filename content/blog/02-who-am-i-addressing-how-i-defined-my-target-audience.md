Just as knowing myself is crucial in building my personal brand, knowing who I am addressing is equally important. After completing my self-assessment (you can check out my post ["Personal Branding - My Journey of Self-Discovery"](/blog/personal-branding-my-journey-of-self-discovery)), the second step I took was to clarify for whom I would create my messages and solutions. Especially as a SaaS developer and solopreneur, it's essential that my products or content reach the right people, genuinely solve their problems, and are offered within the lowest possible budget. In this post, I will try to share how I defined my target audience and my experiences during this process.

When defining my target audience, I knew I needed to dig deeper and narrow down the audience rather than saying "everyone." While structuring this process, I focused on the following steps:

## Drawing the Ideal Customer Profile (Persona)

Who do I want to serve? Whose problems do I enjoy solving, and to whom can I add the most value? My analysis revealed that my target audience consists of solopreneurs like myself, SMEs, and freelancers. While focusing on their demographic characteristics (age range, sectors, etc.), I also paid significant attention to their psychographic traits:

### Pain Points

Analyzing my target audience, I observed they often struggle with time management, find it difficult to focus, get overwhelmed by frequently recurring operational processes like project and invoice tracking, are slowed down by technological complexity, and seek reliable, innovative solutions to grow their businesses. Their goals are to work more efficiently, automate workflows, achieve more with less effort, create time to focus on growing their business, and leverage technology as a tool.

### Creating Personas

Using this information, I created semi-fictional personas like "Marketing Manager Ayşe," "Boutique Store Owner Mehmet," and "Freelance Graphic Designer Elif." This made my target audience more tangible and understandable. If I were to provide a rough draft of the target audience personas I created during this process:

### Market and Competitor Analysis

I researched the existing solutions used by my target audience, their satisfaction levels, and complaints regarding these solutions. I examined whom my competitors target and the messages they use. My goal wasn't to copy but to find the gaps they weren't filling and identify my unique niche. For me, this niche became clear as "empowering solopreneurs and SMEs with AI-powered productivity solutions."

### Social Listening

I actively followed and continue to follow what my target audience talks about, the problems they mention, and the language (communication style) they use on platforms like LinkedIn groups, Reddit (e.g., r/solopreneur, r/smallbusiness), Indie Hackers, and Twitter/X. This helps me better understand their world and stay informed about developments.

Defining and knowing your target audience enables you to reach them with the right message, on the right platform, and with the right solutions. If you also want to reach the right people with your brand, following these steps will be beneficial:

- **Imagine Your Ideal Customer:** Who do you want to serve? What are their biggest problems and goals?
- **Create Personas:** Develop a few personas representing this ideal customer. Give them names, write their stories, detail their problems and motivations. Utilize relevant platforms and real connections while doing this.
- **Listen and Research:** Spend time where your target audience hangs out online (forums, social media groups, etc.). Try to identify what they complain about and what solutions they are looking for.
- **Define Your Niche:** Instead of trying to appeal to everyone, focus on a specific audience or problem where you can add the most value and understand best.

Once you clarify your target audience, crafting your brand's message and story will become much easier. In my next post, I will share how I used this information to create a consistent narrative.
